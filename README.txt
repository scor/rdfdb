The PHP SPARQL Objects (PSO) library defines a lightweight, consistent interface for accessing RDF stores in PHP using the SPARQL query and update language. Each SPARQL endpoint driver that implements the PSO interface can expose store-specific features as regular extension functions. Note that in order to use this interface you must use a store-specific PSO driver to access a SPARQL endpoint. PSO provides a data-access abstraction layer, which means that, regardless of which store you're using, you use the same functions to issue queries and fetch data.
